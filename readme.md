# Cash Machine

## The Problem

Develop a solution that simulate the delivery of notes when a client does a withdraw in a cash machine.
The basic requirements are the follow:
- Always deliver the lowest number of possible notes;
- Itâ€™s possible to get the amount requested with available notes;
- The client balance is infinite;
- Amount of notes is infinite;
- Available notes $ 100,00; $ 50,00; $ 20,00 e $ 10,00

### Example:

- Entry: 30.00
  Result: [20.00, 10.00]
- Entry: 80.00
  Result: [50.00, 20.00, 10.00]
- Entry: 125.00
  Result: throw NoteUnavailableException
- Entry: -130.00
  Result: throw InvalidArgumentException
- Entry: NULL
  Result: [Empty Set]

## The Deliverables:

Make sure your code is well written, focus in good practices and prepare a small (10 minutes) talk/explanation about the decisions in your code/architecture. 
The usage of libraries or frameworks is allowed, if this make your test easier or better feel free to make use of those.

### With the test please delivery:

- API endpoint(s) to test the code
- Tests
- any other material you think could be relevant to enrich your test and why

## The Solution:

- [Index.html](index.html) - The interface that users uses the interface.
- [cashMachine.js](assets/js/cashMachine.js) - Javascript that contains events and functions to calculate it.
- [SpecRunner.html](tests/SpecRunner.html) - To test project functions using [Jasmine.Js](https://jasmine.github.io/) framework.
